## Governance & Transparency  
- The **Community & Ecosystem** allocation is managed by the **CloudAI DAO.**  
- The **Treasury & Growth Fund** is governed through a **multi-sig wallet with a community veto system.**  
- All transactions and fund allocations will be **publicly accessible and reported regularly.**  

---

## Usage, Governance & Vesting  

### **Community & Ecosystem Governance**  
- **Managed by the DAO**, allowing token stakers to **propose and vote** on fund allocation.  
- Funds can be used for growth initiatives, partnerships, or burned if deemed unnecessary.  
- To maintain **price stability and sustainability**, the **Community & Ecosystem Fund may be vested** over time, rather than being available all at once.

### **Treasury Governance: Multi-Sig with Community Oversight**  
To ensure **efficiency and security**, the Treasury & Growth Fund is controlled via a **multi-sig wallet** with:  

1. **Multi-Sig Signers:** A group of **5 to 7 elected signers** manage the treasury.  
2. **Approval Threshold:** A majority (e.g., 3 out of 5 or 4 out of 7) must approve transactions.  
3. **Community Veto System:**  
   - Transactions are **subject to a veto period** (e.g., 72 hours) before execution.  
   - If a certain percentage of token stakers (e.g., 10-20%) veto the transaction, it is blocked.  
4. **Regular Transparency Reports:** Treasury transactions will be **publicly accessible on-chain**, with periodic community reports.  

### **Treasury Vesting & Stability**  
- To maintain **price stability and sustainability**, the **Treasury & Growth Fund may be vested** over time, rather than being available all at once. This **prevents large token movements** that could impact market dynamics.  
- If funds remain unused, **a portion can be burned** to optimize tokenomics.  

### **Founder Vesting Schedule**  
- **1-Year Cliff:** No tokens released in the first year.  
- **4-Year Vesting:** Tokens then unlock gradually over four years, ensuring long-term commitment.
